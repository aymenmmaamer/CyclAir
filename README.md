# CyclAir [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sxmxn/CyclAir.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sxmxn/CyclAir)
CyclAir is a WebApp built with ReactJs and NodeJs as part of a university project at the HTW Berlin.
It provides a mapping service for cyclist that also considers the air quality when calculating routes.

## How to build
If you would like to run the app on your own computer you need to have [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

After cloning the repository run `npm install` from your console. Then navigate into the *client-folder* (e.g. `cd client`) and run `npm install` again.

Run the app with `npm run dev`. You can access the website at <http://127.0.0.1:3000/>.
